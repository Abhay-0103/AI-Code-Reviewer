This review addresses a critical correctness issue in the provided `sum` function. The function attempts to use
undeclared variables, leading to a runtime error. The proposed fix aligns the function's implementation with its name,
making it explicit and reusable.

### Key Issues (Severity)

* **BLOCKER** (Line 1): The function attempts to access undeclared variables `a` and `b`, which will cause a
`ReferenceError` at runtime.

### Detailed Review

#### Correctness

* **Undeclared Variables:** The core issue is that `a` and `b` are not defined within the `sum` function's scope, nor
are they passed as parameters. In strict mode (which is default for ES Modules and often enabled in modern JS),
accessing undeclared variables will throw a `ReferenceError`. Even in non-strict mode, if `a` and `b` don't exist in any
outer scope (e.g., global), it will still fail.
* **Function Purpose:** A function named `sum` typically implies it takes numerical arguments and returns their total.
The current implementation without parameters fails to meet this common expectation.

#### API Contracts

* The function signature `sum()` suggests it takes no inputs. However, its implementation implicitly relies on `a` and
`b` existing in an outer scope. This creates an unclear and fragile API contract. Functions should ideally be
self-contained and explicit about their dependencies through parameters.

#### Readability/Style

* Relying on implicit global or outer-scoped variables (`a`, `b`) is generally considered bad practice. It makes the
function's behavior harder to reason about, test, and reuse in different contexts, as its output depends on external
state that isn't clearly defined by its signature. Explicitly passing arguments is the idiomatic and clearer approach.

### Fixes

The most common, robust, and readable way to implement a `sum` function for two numbers is to pass them as arguments.

#### Corrected Code

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

### Checklist

* [x] Variables are explicitly defined or passed as arguments.
* [x] Function signature accurately reflects its inputs.
* [x] Function is self-contained and does not rely on implicit global state.
* [x] Function is testable in isolation.

### Confidence & Assumptions

* **Confidence:** High. The issue of undeclared variables leading to a `ReferenceError` is a fundamental correctness
problem in JavaScript.
* **Assumptions:** I assumed the intent of the function `sum()` was to add two numbers, typically passed as arguments.
If the intention was different (e.g., to sum values from an array, or to sum specific global variables), the solution
would change, but the current implementation would still be incorrect due to the `ReferenceError`.
