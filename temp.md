This function, `sum`, attempts to return the sum of two variables, `a` and `b`. However, neither `a` nor `b` are defined
within the function's scope or passed as arguments, leading to a `ReferenceError` when executed. Its current
implementation makes it unusable for its intended purpose.

### Key Issues

* **BLOCKER**
* **Undefined Variables** (Line 1): The variables `a` and `b` are not defined in the function's scope or passed as
parameters. This will result in a `ReferenceError` when the function is called.
* **MAJOR**
* **Missing Parameters** (Line 1): For a function named `sum`, it's expected to accept the numbers it should sum as
arguments. Currently, it takes no parameters, making it inflexible and reliant on external variable declarations, which
is poor practice.
* **MINOR**
* **No Input Validation** (Line 1): Even if `a` and `b` were passed as arguments, there's no validation to ensure they
are actually numbers. This could lead to unexpected behavior (e.g., `"1" + "2"` resulting in `"12"`) or runtime errors
if non-numeric types are used in addition.
* **NIT**
* **Missing Documentation** (Line 1): There are no comments or JSDoc to explain the function's purpose, its parameters,
or what it returns.

### Detailed Review

#### Correctness
The primary correctness issue is the use of undefined variables `a` and `b`. JavaScript functions operate within their
lexical scope, and `a` and `b` are neither declared locally nor passed in as parameters, nor are they accessible from an
outer scope. This will cause a `ReferenceError` at runtime, making the function fundamentally broken.

#### Performance
For such a simple operation, performance is not a concern. The main issue is the lack of functionality.

#### Error handling
There is no error handling. If `a` or `b` were somehow accessible (e.g., globally defined) but not numbers, the current
code would perform type coercion (e.g., `1 + "2"` is `"12"`, `1 + undefined` is `NaN`), which might not be the desired
behavior for a `sum` function. A robust implementation should validate input types.

#### API contracts
The name `sum` implies a function that takes numerical inputs and returns their sum. The current implementation violates
this contract by not accepting any inputs and relying on implicitly defined variables.

#### Readability/Style
The code itself is concise, but its lack of explicit parameters and documentation hinders understanding. Without knowing
where `a` and `b` are supposed to come from, the intent is unclear.

#### Testing
This function cannot be meaningfully tested in isolation. Any attempt to call it will immediately throw a
`ReferenceError`. Testing would require defining `a` and `b` in the global scope, which is not how a reusable `sum`
function should work.

#### Edge cases
If `a` and `b` were defined globally, edge cases like `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, strings, or objects would lead to
unexpected results due to JavaScript's type coercion rules for the `+` operator.

#### Docs
The function lacks any form of documentation, making it harder for others (or future self) to understand its intended
usage and behavior.

### Corrected Code

The most common and robust way to implement a `sum` function for two numbers is to accept them as parameters and
validate their types.

```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
*
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
* @throws {TypeError} If a or b are not numbers.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
throw new TypeError('Both arguments must be numbers.');
}
return a + b;
}
```

### Checklist

* [x] Defined `a` and `b` as parameters for the `sum` function.
* [x] Added type validation to ensure both arguments are numbers.
* [x] Included JSDoc comments to clarify the function's purpose, parameters, return value, and potential errors.
* [ ] Consider renaming the function if its intent was to sum more than two numbers (e.g., `sumTwoNumbers`, or accept an
array for `sum`).

### Confidence & Assumptions

**Confidence:** High. The issues are fundamental JavaScript scoping and function design principles.
**Assumptions:** The primary intent was to create a standard utility function that sums two numerical inputs, rather
than interacting with globally scoped variables `a` and `b`.
